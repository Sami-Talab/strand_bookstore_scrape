# Ethical Considerations for Web Scraping

This document outlines the ethical considerations involved in web scraping and how we have addressed them in the context of this project.

## Purpose of Data Collection

The primary goal of this project is to collect publicly available book data (title, author, price) from the Strand Book Shop website. The data is collected to help users quickly access information about books in specific genres or individual book details. The project is strictly intended for **educational and research purposes**, and the data is used to demonstrate web scraping techniques in Python.

## Why Are We Collecting This Data?

We are collecting this data to:

- Automate the process of gathering book information from a public website.
- Facilitate book searches and allow for easy analysis of data (e.g., price comparison, book availability).
- Enhance learning by providing hands-on experience with web scraping using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup.

## Data Sources and `robots.txt`

We respect the website's rules and ensure that we adhere to the `robots.txt` file of the Strand Book Shop. The `robots.txt` file specifies which parts of the website can be crawled or scraped by automated systems. Before scraping any data, we review the rules set by the website:

- **Respect for Robots.txt**: We only scrape pages that are allowed by the site's `robots.txt` file. We do not access restricted areas of the website, ensuring that we follow ethical and legal guidelines.
  - Example URL: `https://www.strandbooks.com/robots.txt`

## Collection Practices

We have implemented the following collection practices to avoid disruption or harm to the website:

1. **Rate Limiting**: The scraper includes deliberate delays (`time.sleep()`) between requests to ensure that it does not overload the website's servers. This helps prevent denial of service issues and reduces the risk of disrupting the website's normal operation.

2. **No Bypassing of Password Protection**: The scraper does not attempt to access any areas of the website that are protected by passwords or other forms of authentication. Only publicly accessible data is collected.

3. **Compliance with Legal and Ethical Standards**: We ensure that the scraping process complies with the website’s terms of service and legal requirements.

## Data Handling and Privacy

We are committed to respecting user privacy and data security:

1. **No Collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: The scraper only collects non-sensitive information, such as book titles, authors, and prices. No personal data, such as user information or account details, is scraped or stored.

2. **Data Security**: If any data is stored during the project, it is stored securely and added to `.gitignore` to ensure it is not accidentally uploaded to public repositories. This helps prevent unauthorized access to the data.

## Data Usage

The data collected in this project is used for **educational and research purposes only**. Specifically:

- The data is analyzed to provide insights into book pricing and availability across various genres.
- The scraping process is intended to teach web scraping techniques and the importance of adhering to ethical and legal guidelines.

We do not use the data for commercial purposes, nor do we distribute the data outside the context of this educational project.

## Conclusion

In this project, we take ethical web scraping seriously. By respecting the website’s `robots.txt` file, limiting scraping to prevent disruption, avoiding the collection of personal information, and ensuring data security, we aim to conduct web scraping in a responsible and ethical manner. The collected data is solely for educational use and demonstrates the importance of ethical considerations in data collection practices.
